# Embedded_UltraSonic_Project

This is an Embedded field related project, which is done by the Layered model and drivers,

This is an  Ultrasonic project which is made of HC-SR04 (ultrasonic), LCD and controlled by an AVR ATMEGA16 microcontroller,

This Project is consisted of the following drivers: ICU , LCD , HC-SR04 , GPIO and (std_types and common macros) libraries,

This project is used to measure the distance by using an ultrasonic which gives a signal to the microcontroller through the ICU, then the microcontroller does some measurments to calculate the distance and display it on the LCD,

And for the simulation on proteus, follow this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1phkdcVxbTlziR_XBNpRkJdenW0iRAk9O?usp=sharing .
